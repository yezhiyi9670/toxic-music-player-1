# Registering and logging in

txmp has a user system. Users can log in, and can register if it is enabled.

## Why register or log in?

By logging in, one can save playlists online. Compared with temporary ones, online playlists have more features, and can be shared with ease.

## Registering

When logged out, click the login icon on the header bar. You will enter the login page.

Register might be limited. In this case, the `Register` button will be grayed out, and you cannot register.

To register, input username, password and password, then hit the `Register` button.

After registeration, you need to retype username and password to log in.

Generally, your password will be protected using strong salted hash and cannot be revealed. However, always keep in mind that this is an open source software and may be modified for malicious purposes.

## Logging in

Click the login icon on the header bar. You will enter the login page. Simply input username and password to login.

## Logging out
