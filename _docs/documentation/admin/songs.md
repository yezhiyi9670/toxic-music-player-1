# Uploading and managing songs

## Creating, renaming and deleting

Songs are stored under `data/music/` and can be managed manually.

For UI management, go to the Song Management page. To do this, click the key icon on the header bar and select 'Manage Songs'.

At the bottom of page, you can see this form.

```plain
+------------------------------------+----------+
| New ID                             | Create   |
+------------------+-----------------+------------+
+------------------+-------------------+----------+
| Old ID           | New ID            | Rename   |
+------------------+-------------------+----------+
```

Song ID can only contain alpha, numbers and `_`.

### Creating

Input ID of the new song, and click Create.

### Changing ID

Input the old ID, then the new ID, and click Rename.

### Deleting

Simply by renaming an ID to `DELETE`. You will see a different dialog when clicking Rename.

## Managing access

Click on any song on the admin list, and you will see the menu.

```plain
+------------------------+
| Edit                   |
